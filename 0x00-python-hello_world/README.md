0x00-python-hello_world - in this project, I used the interpreter, printing strings  and variable and substrings using indexing in python.

The function prototypes used in this project are in the list.h file.

0-run: 
Bash script that runs a Python script file saved in the environment variable $PYFILE.

1-run_inline: 
Bash script that runs Python code saved in the environment variable $PYCODE. 2. Hello, print.

2-print.py: 
Python script that prints the string : "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed 
by a new line using the function print.

3-print_numeber:
Python script that prints out an interger number followed by Battery street, followed by a new line using the print
function.

4-print_float.py:
Python script that prints a float stored in a variable number with a precison of two digits. 

5-print_string.py:
Python script prints a string 3 times, followed by a new line, then the first nine characters in that string
with a new line. 

6-concat.py:
Python script that prints "Welcome to Holberton School!" using strings.

7-edges.py:
Python script that sets three string variables based on the string contained in the variable word as follows: word_first_3: Contains the first three letters of the
variable word. word_last_2: Contains the last two letters of the variable word. middle_word: Contains the value of the variable word without the first and 
last letters. Completion of this source code. 8. Create a new sentence

8-concat_edges.py: 
Python script that prints object-oriented programming with Python, followed by a new line without creating new variables or string literals. 
Completion of this source code. 9. Easter Egg

9-easter_egg.py: 
Python script that prints "The Zen of Python" by Tim Peters, followed by a new line. 10. Linked list cycle

10-check_cycle.c: 
C function that checks if a linked list contains a cycle. Returns 0 if there is no cycle and returns 1 otherwise.

100-write.py: 
Python script that prints exactly and that piece of art is useful - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line to stderr using the function 
write from the sys module. Exits with a status code of 1. 12. Compile

101-compile: 
Python script that compiles a Python script file stored in the environment variable $PYFILE and saves it to an output file 
$PYFILEc (ex. export PYFILE=my_main.py => output filename: my_main.pyc). 13. ByteCode -> Python #1

102-magic_calculation.py: 
Python function matching exactly a bytecode provided by Holberton School.
