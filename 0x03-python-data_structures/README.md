0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples:
python project. In this project I will be implementing and using lists aswell as tuples to write python projects 

All prototypes used are in the list.h file

files:
0-print_list_integer.py:
writes a function that prints all integers of a list 

1-element_at.py:
writes a function that retrieves an element from a list like in c.

2-replace_in_list.py:
writes a function that replaces an element at a specific posiotion.

3-print_reversed_list_integer.py
Python script that writes an function which reverses the elements of a list. 

4-new_in_list.py:
writes a function that replaces an element in list at a specific position without modifying the original list.

5-no_c.py:
writes a function that removes all characters c and C from the string.

6-print_matrix_integer.py:
writes a function that prints a matirix of integers. 

7-add_tuple.py:
writes a function that adds two tuples. 

8-multiple_returns.py:
returns a function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and it's first characters.

9-max_integer.py:
returns a function that returns the biggest integer of a list.

10-divisible_by_2.py:
returns a function that finds prints out intgers which are  multiples of 2.

11-delete_at.py:
returns a function the deletes an item at a specific position.

12-switch.py:
completes the source code :0x03.py/12-switch_py, that swiches two values

13-is_palindrome.c:
returns a function that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome. 

100-print_python_list_info.c
a C function that prints some basic information about Python lists
