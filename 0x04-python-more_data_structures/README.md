0x04-python-more_data_structures
Python project. : I will be working with sets and dictionaries to create functions.

All prototypes used will be in the list.h file. 

0-square_matrix_simple.py:
Python scprit consist of a function that prints the square values of all integers in a matrix  

1-search_replace.py:
Python script that consist of a function that relplaces the occurrences of an element by another in a new list.

2-uniq_add.py:
Python script that consist of a function that adds all unique integers in a list only once for each integer.

3-common_elements.py:
Python script that consist of a function that returns a set of common elements in twp sets.

4-only_diff_elements.py:
Python script that consist of a function that returns a set of all elements in only one set

5-number_keys.py.
returns a function that returns a number of keys in a dictionary

6-print_sorted_dictionary.py:
returns a function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys.

7-update_dictionary.py:
returns a function that updates a dictionary by replacing the key/values of that dictionary 

8-simple_delete.py:
returns a function that deletes a key in a dictionary. 

9-multiply_by_2.py:
Python script that consist of a function that returns a new dictionary with values multiplied by 2.

10-best_score.py:
returns a function that returns a key with the biggest integer value.

11-multiply_list_map.py:
Python script that returns a list with all values multiplied by a number without using any loops.

12-roman_to_int.py:
Python script that consist of a function that converts a Roman numeral to an integer

100-weight_average.py: 
Python function that returns the weighted average of all integers in a list of tuples.
Tuple format: (, ). If the list is empty - returns 0. Without importing modules. 14. Squared by using map

101-square_matrix_map.py: 
Python function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix using map. 
The parameter matrix is a two-dimensional array. Returns a new matrix of the same size as matrix 
with each value squared. 
The initial matrix is not modified. Without using loops or importing modules. 15. Delete by value

102-complex_delete.py: 
Python function that deletes keys with a specific value in a dictionary. If the value does not exists,
the dictionary is not changed. 
All keys having the searched value are deleted. Without importing modules. 16. CPython #1: PyBytesObject

103-python.c: 
C functions that print basic information about Python lists and Python bytes objects.
